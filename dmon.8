.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdmon [options] cmd [cmdoptions] [\-\- logcmd [logcmdoptions]]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBdmon\fP program will launch a program and re\-launch it whenever it
dies. Optionally, the standard output streams of the programs may be piped
into a second program (named \fIlog command\fP), which will receive the output
of the program in its standard input stream. The log command will be also
monitored and re\-launched when it dies.
.SH USAGE
.sp
Command line options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-p \ PATH
.
Write the PID of the master \fBdmon\fP process to a file in the
specified \fIPATH\fP. You can signal the process to interact with
it. (See \fI\%SIGNALS\fP below.)
.TP
.B \-n
.
Do not daemonize: \fBdmon\fP will keep working in foreground,
without detaching and without closing its standard input and
output streams. This is useful for debugging and, to a limited
extent, to run interactive programs.
.TP
.B \-e
.
Redirect both the standard error and standard output streams
to the log command. If not specified, only the standard output
is redirected.
.TP
.B \-s
.
Forward signals \fICONT\fP, \fIALRM\fP, \fIQUIT\fP, \fIUSR1\fP, \fIUSR2\fP and
\fIHUP\fP to the monitored command when \fBdmon\fP receives them.
.TP
.B \-S
.
Forward signals \fICONT\fP, \fIALRM\fP, \fIQUIT\fP, \fIUSR1\fP, \fIUSR2\fP and
\fIHUP\fP to the log command when \fBdmon\fP receives them.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\-h, \-?        Show a summary of available options.
.sp
Usual log commands include \fIdlog(8)\fP and \fIdsyslog(8)\fP, which are part of the
\fBdmon\fP suite. Other log commands like \fIrotlog(8)\fP or \fImultilog(8)\fP may be
used as long as they consume data from standard input and do not detach
themsemlves from the controlling process.
.SH SIGNALS
.sp
Signals may be used to interact with the monitored processes and \fBdmon\fP
itself.
.sp
The \fBTERM\fP and \fBINT\fP signals are catched by \fBdmon\fP, and they will
make it shut down gracefully: both the main command and the log command
will receive a \fBTERM\fP signal followed by a \fBCONT\fP and they will be
waited for.
.sp
When at least one of \fB\-s\fP or \fB\-S\fP are used, the \fBCONT\fP, \fBALRM\fP,
\fBQUIT\fP, \fBUSR1\fP, \fBUSR2\fP and \fBHUP\fP signals are forwarded to the
managed processes. By default, if none of the options are used, those
signals are ignored.
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
The following command will supervise a shell which prints a string each
fifth second, and the output is logged to a file with timestamps:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dmon \-n sh \-c \(aqwhile echo "Hello World" ; do sleep 5 ; done\(aq \e
  \-\- dlog logfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In order to turn the previous example into a daemon, we only need to
remove the \fB\-n\fP. I may be convenient to specify a PID file path:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dmon \-p example.pid \e
  sh \-c \(aqwhile echo "Hello dmon" ; do sleep 5 ; done\(aq \e
  \-\- dlog logfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If you have a PID file, terminating the daemon is an easy task:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
kill $(cat example.pid)
.ft P
.fi
