 DMon - Process Monitoring With Style
======================================

This README contains only some random bits. For more in-depth writing, you
may want to read the articles on DMon:

There are also manual pages, so please take a look at them.


Bulding a multicall binary
==========================

As an option it is supported to build all tools into a single binary which
can be symlinked with different names to switch between them (àla BusyBox).
This is useful to save space i.e. in embedded devices.

You can build all DMon tools this way by passing ``MULTICALL=1`` to Make::

  make MULTICALL=1

Remember to pass the option when doing ``make install`` as well::

  make MULTICALL=1 install


Building libnofork.so
---------------------
A tiny LD_PRELOAD-able "libnofork.so" library can be built by passing
LIBNOFORK=1 to make. This library overrides the fork(2) and daemon(3)
functions from the system libraries, in such a way that the process under
effect will not be able of forking. This is interesting for running DMon
with programs that have no option to instruct them not to fork.
