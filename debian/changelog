dmon (0.3.1) stable; urgency=high

  * Fix: Do not handle SIGSTOP. This is very important because without this
  	fix most dmon use-cases will not work at all.

dmon (0.3) stable; urgency=low

  * New options -L/-l to pause-and-resume the process depending on
    system load.
  * New options -u/-U/-g/-G to set user and group credentials for
    main command and logging command.
  * Fix: A 1-second wait is introduced before executing child processes
    to avoid fork+exec DoS.
  * Fix: Now SIGSTOP is forwarded to child processes when using -S/-s.
  * Handier help output with -h/-?
